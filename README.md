# Sudoku-Solver
This sudoku solver implements a backtracking algorithm on a pygame GUI.

# Instructions
Once the GUI is running, click any box and enter a guess. To submit the guess, press Enter. If the guess is correct, the box will populate; otherwise a red X will appear on the bottom of the screen. Press Delete to cancel a guess. To watch the backtracker solve the puzzle, press Space upon running the sudoku_gui.py.
